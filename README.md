# News-Scraper

News-Scraper is an Atlanta Braves fan news web source.  I grew up watching the Braves and it has been a blast having the opportunity to build a web app to combine my childhood favorite sports team and my passion for web development.

```

If you wish to download the repository and run the code locally, you will need to ensure that you use the package manager (NPM), to install the needed dependencies:

```bash
    "axios": "^0.18.0",
    "cheerio": "^1.0.0-rc.3",
    "express": "^4.17.0",
    "express-handlebars": "^3.1.0",
    "mongoose": "^5.5.9",
    "morgan": "^1.9.1"
```

## Technical Application Specs

This project utilizes javascript, express, dotenv, ajax, mongoDB, and node.js to render the website.  This project uses an MVC model approach. NPM dependencies are listed above.  Morgan is included to maintain visibility on the routes that are called in the running of the application.  It is a very useful tool for development but is not a requirement for a production environment.
